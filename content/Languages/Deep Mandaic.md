The most secret script of the innermost rites of the deep sects of the deep desert. The birth-tongue, it is claimed, of the [[Mother of Ants]] herself.

There is a story known to jewellers: of a guild-master who made a wager with a keeper of butterflies. The master-jeweller claimed his jewelled egg would hatch something greater than any of the butterfly-keeper's chrysalids. Of course, after a month, the butterfly-keeper's gardens were bright with wings and the egg had hatched nothing at all. The jeweller, unable to pay his debts, fled into the desert with his egg. [[Horomachistry]] teaches us: know your limits.
