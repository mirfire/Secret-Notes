There is a History where Alexander defeated first the Great Knot of Sabazos, and then the King of Kings. There is another History where, instead, he learnt from them. How many more? If we curl our hands into the correct shapes, we may yet understand.

There's a story told by sailors, about a city of ivory and iron across the sea. Those who come there never die, but those who leave again have never lived. Only in another History, they say; but if you rig your sails right, you might just catch the wind that takes you there in this one.
