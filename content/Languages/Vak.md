Before gods arose from blood, before ever ape stood upright, this was the language heard in the [[House of the Sun]].... 'I am [[Vak]],' the [[Peacock Door]] boasted, 'both the tongue and the Goddess. I am the only entrance into secret light. I was worshipped before you upright apes, and I will be still when all of you are ugly ash. Listen, and I will prove it.'

Something not commonly understood: were there no [[Calyptra]] to conceal perilous knowledge, there could be no [[Vak]]. A door opens both ways. This is understood by scholars of the Arts Unregarded.
