The Shepherd-Kings brought this speech west from Canaan to use in their wards and snares. Had they never come to Egypt, they might never found a way to write it; given its addictive qualities, that might have been for the best.

The veterans of the [[Légion du Seuil]], who guard the boundaries of the waking world, tell stories of the [[Labyrinths]] under the [[Mansus]], above the [[Wood]], and inside the [[Moon]], where the first fallen [[Hours]] sleep, or hide, or rot: the [[gods-from-stone]]. Why the [[Labyrinths]]? Because, the [[Légion du Seuil|legionnaires]] say, there are [[Hours]] ruling now who would fight to consume the last scraps of their old enemies; and those who feast would eclipse those who abstain. The [[Légion du Seuil|legionnaires]] have been known to boast that if they were only offered a great enough prize, they could guide the hungry Hours to their feast.
