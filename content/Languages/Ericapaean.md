A language of surpassing beauty and allusiveness, revealed through the ecstatic apprehensions of the Orphics, the Eleusinians, and the Sibyls of the Rhine. Ericapaean, these mystics claimed, allows the elaboration of hues, sensations and states of mind too subtle for grosser tongues.

There is a story told by students of silence: that a great and golden King held the only key to his deepest prison cell. One day he gave the key to his minister, and offered him a choice: to submit to execution, or to visit the cell and tell him what he found there. The minister made the wiser choice, and returned to show the King what he had found in the cell: a mirror. 'Then I release you,' the King declared. The minister left the palace that same day. His reflection, of course, said nothing at all.
