[[Ask Neyra]] for a convo with him

Exile riddle monger [[Thunderskin]] devotee a confidant impecably dressed in dark clothing, dark the dressing too at his ankles and wrists, he wont take a seat, would be unkind of him to accept

Dr Arun Peel: can teach languages [[Vak]] and [[Fucine]]; he was once of a high and dedicated lineage, but left behind his life to serve the [[Thunderskin]]

The [[Thunderskin]] is an [[Hours|Hour]] which "beats to protect the skin of the world". He was originally a musician who loved the [[Red Grail]] and ascended under her as a [[Names|Name]]. He later came to love the [[Ring-Yew]], and was flayed by the [[Red Grail]] as part of a treaty to placate [[The Horned-Axe]], as well as to help the [[Red Grail|Grail]] challenge the power of the [[Twins]] over the aspect of Heart.

Can teach:
- [[Vak]]
- [[Fucine]]
- [[Coptic]]
