One-time Librarian of Hush House, one-time Librarian of the Invisible Serapeum in Alexandria, and currently... what, exactly? Serena is close-mouthed, but I know that she has worked with the St Rhonwen Trust.

She speaks weird languages:
- [[Arameic]]
- [[Latin]]
- [[Fucine]] - dry language, people lived east of lake fushino, land of witches, language of them. Tongue of witches
can buy
