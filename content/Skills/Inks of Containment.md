> The inks in which the Histories are preserved.

**[[Winter]]** 2, **[[Moon]]** 1

Linked to [[Horomachistry]] and [[Preservation]]

Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortals… unless it's wisely contained. This law is named Calyptra; the enforcement of this law is named Calyptra also; the three Hours who enforce it share that name. They permit that knowledge to persist only in certain sanctioned places, and the most dangerous secrets must only be recorded in the inks called encaustum terminale. Horomachistry teaches us Calyptra's importance.

Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortals… except in nine great libraries protected by the covenant-stones they hold, where this knowledge can be safely recorded in the inks called encaustum terminale. These libraries are together called the Watchman's Tree, and the covenant marked by these stones shares that name. All this, then, is a matter of Preservation. 

## Uses

This skill is useful against [[Theoplasmic Contamination]].

## Notes

These inks are meant to preserve. To conserve. To remember. Whatever is written with these inks may not die or be forgotten about.
