> The Hunter, the Way, and their memories.

**[[Sky]]** 2, **[[Scale]]** 1

Linked to [[The Bosk]] and [[Nyctodromy]]

> When the first hunters were lost in the Wood, in the days before its darkening, they found a chrysalis of black and white. To it they sacrificed the birds of the air, so that it would show them the way home. So the Moth came to be, and so the Moth was the first to navigate the ways of the Wood. This is the foundation of Nyctodromy. 

> When the first hunters were starving in the Wood, in the days before its darkening, they found a deep and crimson well. In it they drowned the beasts of the earth, so that the beasts would be reborn threefold, and the hunters could feast. So the Red Grail came to be, and so ever since she feeds us and she feeds upon us. This, the Matriarchs of the Knot have taught us.
