> When the Moth goes a-hunting in the dark of the Wood, he remembers a time when the Wood was bright, but he uses his horns to find the way, and we may follow him if we choose. After all, a trophy is nothing without a hunt: that's the lesson of the Wood.

> When the Chandler goes a-hunting in the dark of the Wood, he shields his candle so his prey is not forewarned, but he leaves a trail of ivory wax so we may follow him and purchase his prizes. After all, the goal of every hunt is to bring home a trophy, and when we understand Skolekosophy, we know how to bargain.
