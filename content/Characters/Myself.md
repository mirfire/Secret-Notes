## My Past Life

**[[Kull]]** : I was a soldier. I took part in the [[Great War]]. It changed me irrevocably. My instincts drove me to death and ruin. I saw death. All I have left is a sixpence.

**[[Wist]]** : I tried to put my past away. Forget what I have seen, what I have felt. But the memories stayed. I earned a threepence.

**[[Setre]]** : I tried to explore my past, make amends. Some of it was kept, some of it was sold. None of it made me rich. I earned a sixpence.l

## My New Life

I am part of the Ethos Synod. We aspire to something greater.

## My Connections

I am irrevocably linked to [[Valitri's Character]] and [[Vonte's Character]]
