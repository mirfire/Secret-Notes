## My Past Life

**Kull** : I was driven by instinct. I saw death. I was a soldier. I've earned a sixpence.

**Wist** : I tried to put my past away. Forget what I've seen. But the memories stayed.  I earned a threepence.

**Setre** : I tried to explore my past, make amends. Some of it was kept, some of it was sold. None of it made me rich.

## My New Life

We are an Ethos Synod.
## My Connections

I am irrevocably linked to [[Valitri's Character]] and [[Vonte's Character]]
