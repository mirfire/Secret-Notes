## Who Am I

I am René, born in Havrincourt, a small village near Cambrai in the north of France, in 1892. I lived a mostly uneventful life helping my father building and repairing houses until the order for general mobilisation on August 2<sup>nd</sup> 1914. Every able man was ordered to join the army and defend the Republic against the German Empire.

### The War

During [[The Great War]], I was assigned to the 43<sup>rd</sup> infantry regiment. We fought against the initial attack of the Germans, and pushed them back, a bit. Then we were deep in the mud, stuck in the trenches for months on end. Artillery barrages were an almost daily occurence. From the valley of the Marne where we pushed back the Germans, we were then ordered to help defend Verdun. My regiment was decimated there. I myself managed to survive. But my luck ran short and my leg was hit by shrapnel.

I was taken to the backlines to heal. I lucked out and I managed to avoid amputation. But I will probably always have a limp in my right leg. I was not to join back my regiment, and was moved to logistics. For the rest of the war, I would then drive bikes, cars, trucks, tractors carrying postcards, supplies, shells, bodies, back and forth from the frontlines. I learned of my father's death during this time. I hadn't even realized I hadn't seen him in two years.

### After the War

After the war, I made my way back with my family to my village. It was no longer there. Only ruins, craters, bodies, shells. The church was razed, the castle was bombed. I stayed there, helped rebuild the village as much as I could.

## My Past Life

**[[Kull]]** : I was a soldier. I took part in the [[The Great War|Great War]]. It changed me irrevocably. My instincts drove me to death and ruin. I saw death. All I have left is a sixpence.

**[[Wist]]** : I tried to put my past away. Forget what I have seen, what I have felt. But the memories stayed. I earned a threepence.

**[[Setre]]** : I tried to explore my past, make amends. Some of it was kept, some of it was sold. None of it made me rich. I earned a sixpence.

## My New Life

I am part of the Ethos Synod. We aspire to something greater.

## My Connections

I am irrevocably linked to [[Valitri's Character]] and [[Vonte's Character]].
