# My Life

**Kull** : I was driven by instinct. I saw death. I was a soldier. I've earned a sixpence.

**Wist** : I tried to put my past away. Forget what I've seen. But the memories stayed.  I earned a threepence.

**Setre** : I tried to explore my past, make amends. Some of it was kept, some of it was sold. None of it made me rich.

STRONGEST : KULL
AWAKENING : WIST
LINGERING : SETRE

WHAT WAS LEFT OF AN OLD WORLD : KULL *An old, primal instinct.*
